## The Importance of a Good Git Workflow

A well-defined Git workflow helps teams collaborate efficiently, reduces merge conflicts, and maintains a clean project history. Here's a practical guide to essential Git workflows.

## Feature Branch Workflow

The feature branch workflow is popular for its simplicity and effectiveness:

```bash
# Create a new feature branch
git checkout -b feature/user-authentication

# Make changes and commit them
git add .
git commit -m "Add user authentication system"

# Push the branch to remote
git push -u origin feature/user-authentication

# Create a pull request (via GitHub/GitLab/etc.)
# After review and approval, merge to main
```

## Keeping Branches Updated

Always keep your branches updated with the latest changes from the main branch:

```bash
# While on your feature branch
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/main

# Or merge approach
git merge origin/main
```

## Writing Good Commit Messages

Commit messages should be clear and descriptive:

```bash
# Bad
git commit -m "Fix bug"

# Good
git commit -m "Fix user authentication timeout issue"

# Even better (with body)
git commit -m "Fix user authentication timeout issue" -m "Increases token expiration time from 1 hour to 24 hours and adds refresh token functionality."
```

## Git Hooks for Quality Control

Use Git hooks to enforce quality standards:

```bash
# Example pre-commit hook to run linters
#!/bin/sh
npm run lint
npm run test

# Exit with non-zero status if linting or tests fail
```

## Handling Merge Conflicts

When conflicts arise, resolve them carefully:

```bash
# During a merge or rebase with conflicts
git status  # See which files have conflicts

# Edit the files to resolve conflicts
# Then mark as resolved
git add resolved-file.js

# Continue the merge or rebase
git merge --continue
# or
git rebase --continue
```

## Conclusion

A consistent Git workflow improves team productivity and code quality. Start with these basics and adapt them to your team's specific needs.
