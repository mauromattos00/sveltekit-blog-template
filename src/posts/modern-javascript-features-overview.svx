## Introduction

JavaScript continues to evolve with new features that make code more concise, readable, and powerful. This post highlights some of the most useful modern JavaScript features you should be using in your projects.

## Arrow Functions

Arrow functions provide a shorter syntax and lexical `this` binding:

```javascript
// Traditional function
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

// Arrow function
const add = (a, b) => a + b;
```

## Destructuring Assignment

Easily extract values from objects and arrays:

```javascript
// Object destructuring
const { name, age } = person;

// Array destructuring
const [first, second] = items;
```

## Spread and Rest Operators

Spread elements or collect them into an array:

```javascript
// Spread operator
const newArray = [...oldArray, newItem];
const newObject = { ...oldObject, newProp: value };

// Rest operator
function sum(...numbers) {
  return numbers.reduce((total, num) => total + num, 0);
}
```

## Optional Chaining

Safely access nested properties without checking each level:

```javascript
// Without optional chaining
const street = user && user.address && user.address.street;

// With optional chaining
const street = user?.address?.street;
```

## Nullish Coalescing

Provide fallbacks for null or undefined values:

```javascript
// Returns fallback only if value is null or undefined
const result = value ?? fallback;
```

## Conclusion

These modern JavaScript features can significantly improve your code quality and developer experience. Start incorporating them into your projects to write more elegant and maintainable code.
